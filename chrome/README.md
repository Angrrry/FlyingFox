2. Copy the chosen `userChrome-*.css` and `vars.css`, and paste them in the Chrome directory in your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, go to `about:support`.

3. Go to `about:config` and set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.

4. Follow instructions for each extension in readme under their respective directories.
