## Installation

1. Copy userChrome.css in the Chrome directory in your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, go to about:support.

2. Go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.

3. Follow instructions for each extension in readme under their respective directories.

## Optional

1. Background of sidebar is changed based on firefox theme. You can set my theme with [Firefox Color here](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAIfAQAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCia2CaaEGccwS-xNKlhWuMf61H-qemtFQ7JmIThKEJYbO6BYtxXFN3QVwfgIyLdrYygaud86UIpkiO8YN31rNYQT4wbIyYwCNHU7jaUMww6R7XMYKHXDUCvMW7_0AiLugqKwZ2mhpvOqQw__PRrGb_w5dNZqMUkPfE4UsOjehwu76ZgYlAyi-kcs2o76aC30rqSaUf9RJtUHhA_oQODqn_yh5tM). Setting the background color same as your title bar would give a nice look.
